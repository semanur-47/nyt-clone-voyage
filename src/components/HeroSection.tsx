                In a remarkable display of international unity, representatives from 50 nations have successfully concluded 
                what many are calling the most significant diplomatic gathering of the decade. The three-day summit, held 
                in Geneva, produced a comprehensive framework for addressing global challenges ranging from climate change 
                to economic inequality.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The agreement, dubbed the "Geneva Accord," establishes binding commitments for carbon neutrality by 2040, 
                creates new mechanisms for international trade cooperation, and introduces innovative approaches to conflict 
                resolution. Secretary-General Elena Virtanen hailed the achievement as "a testament to what humanity can 
                accomplish when we work together toward common goals."
